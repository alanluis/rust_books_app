# Book Management System

This is a simple book management system developed in Rust. The system allows you to add, list, and manage information about books. Below are some of the key features of the system:

## Features

### 1. Add Book
- You can add new books to the catalog by providing information such as title, author, genre, and publication year. The added books are stored in the catalog for future reference.

### 2. List Books
- The system allows you to list the books available in the catalog. Books are presented in an organized manner, including detailed information such as title, author, genre, and year of publication.

### 3. Interactive Menu
- The system includes an interactive menu that enables users to choose between adding a new book, listing books, or exiting the program. The menu facilitates navigation and interaction with the system.

### 4. Error Handling
- The system includes error handling to ensure that user inputs are validated. For example, it prevents the addition of books with blank fields and handles division by zero when adding books.

## How to Use

To run the book management system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure that you have the Rust environment set up.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
